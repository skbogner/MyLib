# MyLib
Implementations of standard data structures and algorithms.

This is a personal project entirely for my own sake.

## Goal
The goal is to challenge myself and along the way get more intimate with Elixir, possibly even good at it.

### Complexities | [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com)
Getting familiar with standard algorithms and their complexities is one part of the project. They form a basis from which you can build larger more complex software and algorithms.

#### Algorithms (ongoing) | [Primer](http://discrete.gr/complexity)
- [ ] Dijkstra's
- [ ] Floyd-Warshall
- [ ] Traveling Salesman
- [ ] A*
- [ ] Bloom Filter
- [ ] Breadth-First Iterative Search
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] K-Way Merge
- [ ] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Selection Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] In-place Quick Sort
- [ ] Bucket Sort
- [ ] Radix Sort
- [ ] Closest Pair

Getting familiar with standard data structures and their complexities is the other part of the project. Combined with the algorithms I should have a great foundation on which to build.

#### Data structures (ongoing) | [Data Science Tutorials - TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/)

- [ ] Vector (Dynamic Array)
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Circular Queue
- [ ] Hash Map
- [ ] Set
- [ ] Priority Queue
- [ ] Binary Search Tree


## Success criteria
I will gladly call this project a success if I achieve anything like fluency in Elixir. Of course I hope to implement as many as possible of the different algorithms and data structures, but this is a personal project and such doesn't need to be complete.
